# Binary Trees

This project is part of the group projects given to Software Engineering students at ALX Africa. It contains solutions to different problems/coding challenges about binary trees. The goal of the project is to enhance our understanding of the following conceps:

1. Creating a node
2. Inserting a node
3. Deleting a node
4. Deleting a tree
5. Checking if a node is a leaf
6. Checking if a given node is a root
7. Pre-order traversal
8. In-order traversal
9. Post-order traversal 
10. Height of a tree
11. Depth of a tree
12. Size of a tree
13. Counting leave of a tree
14. Counting nodes of a tree with at least one child
15. Measuring the balance factor of a binary tree
16. Check if a binary tree is full
17. Check if a binary tree is perfect
18. Find the sibling of a node
19. Find the uncles of a node
